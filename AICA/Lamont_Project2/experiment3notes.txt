Experiment 3: J1 = 1, J2 = -.1
VISUAL OBSERVATIONS
1. R1=1, R2=2, h=0			Fairly thin zebra stripes

//the bias hugely decides which pattern the system follows
*2. R1=1, R2=5, h=-4			Most cells go to white 
3. R1=1, R2=5, h=-2			Mostly white, but with several small black stripes
*4. R1=1, R2=5, h=0			Intermixed white and black stripes
5. R1=1, R2=5, h=2			Primarily black, with few white stripes
*6. R1=1, R2=5, h=4			Almost entirely black dominated, with a few white cells

//mostly thin stripes, with the bias deciding which color dominates
7. R1=1, R2=9, h=-6			Mostly white, with several diagonal black stripes
8. R1=1, R2=9, h=-3			Large black stripes intermixed with white stripes
9. R1=1, R2=9, h=0			Longer but thinner diagonal black stripes mixed with white stripes
10. R1=1, R2=9, h=3			More intermixed, continuous stripes with roughly equal black and white
11. R1=1, R2=9, h=6			Mostly black with several white stripes mixed in

//intermixed patterns that are not straight stripes. 12 and 16 are roughly inverse of each other
12. R1=1, R2=14, h=-6   Several diagonal stripes of intermixed white and black
13. R1=1, R2=14, h=-3		Similar structure to step 12, but with larger white stripes	
14. R1=1, R2=14, h=0		Less regular looking stripes than before, with even wider white stripes
15. R1=1, R2=14, h=3		Several different patterns emerged:
													There was several stripes similar to step 12
													There was one thick column of black surrounded by white
													There were stripes similar to step 14.
16. R1=1, R2=14, h=6		Pretty evenly spread black and white stripes, slightly thicker than 12

//in these experiments, the bias seems to have a much larger effect due to the smaller radius
17. R1=3, R2=5, h=-1		Consists of black stripes that slowly die out to all white
18. R1=3, R2=5, h=0			Roughly half black connected splotches appear
19. R1=3, R2=5, h=1			Either entirely black or single white thin stripe appears

//less stripes, but interconnected stripelike structures appear
//the highest and lowest biases mostly dominate the system
20. R1=3, R2=9, h=-6		Mostly white with a very few black patches
21. R1=3, R2=9, h=-3		Mostly white, but with more black patches
*22. R1=3, R2=9, h=0			The entire system is connected in a strange way, with equal black and white
23. R1=3, R2=9, h=3			Mostly black with a few semilarge white patches
24. R1=3, R2=9, h=6			Mostly black with a very few small white patches

//less stripes than usual, more unusual designs appear.
//bias appears to effect this set less than others, most share semi-equal white and black
25. R1=3, R2=14, h=-6 	Slightly more white than black, but in mostly connected stripe patterns
26. R1=3, R2=14, h=-3		Similar to 25, but the white stripes are a little thinner overall
27. R1=3, R2=14, h=0		Pretty thick white and black stripes appear imperfectly
28. R1=3, R2=14, h=3		More frequent thinner connected black and white stripes appear
29. R1=3, R2=14, h=6		Roughly the same black and white, but with an interesting pattern where
													the black fills the middle and disconnects white stripes

//only horizontal white stripes survive against black. No horizontal white stripes appear.
30. R1=7, R2=9, h=-1 		The system is dominated by white 3 times and black 1 time
31. R1=7, R2=9, h=0			Single fat white stripe between two black stripes
32. R1=7, R2=9, h=1			Single fat white stripe similar to 31. 

//these occasionally have horizontal thick white stripes, otherwise the system will die out
33. R1=7, R2=14, h=-3		Either divided evenly horizontially between black and white 
													or diagonal stripes
34. R1=7, R2=14, h=0		Diagonal patterns die out, thick white stripes occasionally appear
35. R1=7, R2=14, h=3		Goes entirely black or entirely white

//The only patterns come with a negative bias. 
36. R1=12, R2=14, h=-2	Diagonal thick evenly spaced stripes, horizontal lines, and pure black
37. R1=12, R2=14, h=0		All die out to either black or white.
38. R1=12, R2=14, h=2		All die out to either black or white
